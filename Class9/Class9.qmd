> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
xray.total <- sum(as.numeric( gsub(",","",db$X.ray)))
em.total <- sum(as.numeric( gsub(",","",db$EM)))
```

```{r}
sum_comma <- function(x) {
  sum(as.numeric( gsub(",","",x)))
}
```

```{r}
sum_comma(db$X.ray)
```

```{r}
sum_comma(db$EM)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round( sum_comma(db$EM)/ sum_comma(db$Total), 2)
```

X/ray
```{r}
round( sum_comma(db$X.ray)/ sum_comma(db$Total), 2)
```
 EM
```{r}
round( sum_comma(db$Total[1]) / sum_comma(db$Total) , 2)
```


> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

Skipped!

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The structure is too low resolution to see H atoms. You need a sub 1 Angstrom resolution to see Hydrogen. 

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH308

# Working with Structures in R

We can use the `bio3D` package to read and perform bioinformatics calcuations on PDB structures. 

```{r}
library(bio3d)
 pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
 pdb
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 
  198
> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 
  HOH
> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 
  2

Read an ADK structure

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
```

```{r}
# Perform flexiblity prediction
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)

```

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
